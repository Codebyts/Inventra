# Inventra
Project Overview

HTML was used in the Inventra system to build the structure of the interface, including
the layout for forms, tables, buttons, and headings. CSS was responsible for styling
the application, applying custom pastel themes, responsive design, and enabling a
smooth dark/light mode. JavaScript handled all interactivity, such as adding, editing,
and deleting inventory items, toggling the theme, and displaying toast notifications.
The system also used local storage to save inventory data within the browser, which
allowed the system to work without a database. Since no backend or database is
involved, the entire system runs completely on the client side.
